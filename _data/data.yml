    title: An O(log log n)-Approximation for Submodular Facility Location
    authors: Fateme Abbasi, Marek Adamczyk, Miguel Bosch-Calvo, Jarosław Byrka, Fabrizio Grandoni, Krzysztof Sornat, and Antoine Tinguely
    conference: ICALP 2024

    abstract: In the Submodular Facility Location problem (SFL) we are given a collection of n clients and m facilities in a metric space. A feasible solution consists of an assignment of each client to some facility. For each client, one has to pay the distance to the associated facility. Furthermore, for each facility f to which we assign the subset of clients S_f, one has to pay the opening cost g(S_f), where g(⋅) is a monotone submodular function with g(\emptyset)=0. SFL is APX-hard since it includes the classical (metric uncapacitated) Facility Location problem (with uniform facility costs) as a special case. Svitkina and Tardos [SODA'06] gave the current-best O(log n) approximation algorithm for SFL. The same authors pose the open problem whether SFL admits a constant approximation and provide such an approximation for a very restricted special case of the problem. We make some progress towards the solution of the above open problem by presenting an O(loglog n) approximation. Our approach is rather flexible and can be easily extended to generalizations and variants of SFL. In more detail, we achieve the same approximation factor for the practically relevant generalizations of SFL where the opening cost of each facility f is of the form p_f+g(S_f) or w_fg(S_f), where pf,wf\geq 0 are input values. We also obtain an improved approximation algorithm for the related Universal Stochastic Facility Location problem. In this problem one is given a classical (metric) facility location instance and has to a priori assign each client to some facility. Then a subset of active clients is sampled from some given distribution, and one has to pay (a posteriori) only the connection and opening costs induced by the active clients. The expected opening cost of each facility f can be modelled with a submodular function of the set of clients assigned to f.

    title: A 4/3 Approximation for 2-Vertex-Connectivity
    authors: Miguel Bosch-Calvo, Fabrizio Grandoni, and Afrouz Jabal Ameli

    journal_doi:
    abstract: The 2-Vertex-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem (2VCSS) is among the most basic NP-hard (Survivable) Network Design problems. We are given an (unweighted) undirected graph G. Our goal is to find a subgraph S of G with the minimum number of edges which is 2-vertex-connected, namely S remains connected after the deletion of an arbitrary node. 2VCSS is well-studied in terms of approximation algorithms, and the current best (polynomial-time) approximation factor is 10/7 by Heeger and Vygen [SIDMA'17] (improving on earlier results by Khuller and Vishkin [STOC'92] and Garg, Vempala and Singla [SODA'93]).

    title: An improved kernel for the flip distance problem on simple convex polygons
    authors: Miguel Bosch-Calvo, Steven Kelk
    conference: CCCG 2021
    conference_link: https://projects.cs.dal.ca/cccg2021/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CCCG2021.pdf
    journal: Information Processing Letters
    journal_doi: 10.1016/j.ipl.2023.106381
    abstract: The complexity of computing the flip distance between two triangulations of a simple convex polygon is unknown. Here we approach the problem from a parameterized complexity perspective and improve upon the 2k kernel of Lucas [12]. Specifically, we describe a kernel of size  and then show how it can be improved to  for every constant. By ensuring that the kernel consists of a single instance our result yields a kernel of the same magnitude (up to additive terms) for the almost equivalent rotation distance problem on rooted, ordered binary trees. The earlier work of Lucas left the kernel as a disjoint set of instances, potentially allowing very minor differences in the definition of the size of instances to accumulate, causing a constant-factor distortion in the kernel size when switching between flip distance and rotation distance formulations. Our approach avoids this sensitivity. We have also undertaken experiments to understand how much reduction is achieved by our kernel in practice.

    title: A 5/4 Approximation for Two-Edge Connectivity
    authors: Miguel Bosch-Calvo, Mohit Garg, Fabrizio Grandoni, Felix Hommelsheim, Afrouz Jabal Ameli, Alexander Lindermayr
    abstract: The 2-Edge Connected Spanning Subgraph problem (2ECSS) is among the most basic survivable network design problems. Given an undirected unweighted graph, find a subgraph with the minimum number of edges which is 2-edge-connected (i.e., it remains connected after the removal of any single edge). This NP-hard problem is well-studied in terms of approximation algorithms. The current-best approximation factor for 2ECSS is 1.3+\varepsilon for any constant \varepsilon > 0 [Garg, Grandoni, Jabal-Ameli'23; Kobayashi,Noguchi'23]. In this paper we present a much simpler 9/7 approximation algorithm, and a more complex 5/4 one. Our algorithms are also faster, their running time is n^{O(1)} instead of n^{O(1/\varepsilon)}.

    title: A PTAS for Triangle-Free 2-Matching
    authors: Miguel Bosch-Calvo, Fabrizio Grandoni, Afrouz Jabal Ameli
    abstract: "In the Triangle-Free (Simple) 2-Matching problem we are given an undirected graph G=(V,E). Our goal is to compute a maximum-cardinality M⊆E satisfying the following properties: (1) at most two edges of M are incident on each node (i.e., M is a 2-matching) and (2) M does not induce any triangle. In his Ph.D. thesis from 1984, Harvitgsen presents a complex polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, with a very complex analysis. This result was never published in a journal nor reproved in a different way, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper we have a fresh look at this problem and present a simple PTAS for it based on local search. Our PTAS exploits the fact that, as long as the current solution is far enough from the optimum, there exists a short augmenting trail (similar to the maximum matching case)."
